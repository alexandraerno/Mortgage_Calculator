# Mortgage_Calculator

This program is intended to help first-time buyers. 
The user can choose to calculate their monthly mortgage payments, based on the property value, interest rate, deposit and length of mortgage. 
The other option is to calculate how much they would need to save every month to reach their desired deposit.
